### Steps to Measure Blood Pressure:

1. **Prepare and Position**:
   - Ensure the scene is safe and take standard precautions.
   - Introduce yourself and obtain permission to help.
   - Select the correct cuff size (regular, large adult, or pediatric) to ensure accurate readings.

2. **Apply the Cuff**:
   - Deflate the cuff completely and place it on the patient’s upper arm, **1–2 inches above the elbow crease**.
   - Ensure the **arrow on the cuff** points to the brachial artery, located on the **inner side of the arm** at the elbow.
   - Place the cuff **directly on the skin**, not over clothing, and ensure it is **snug but not tight**.

3. **Position the Equipment**:
   - Place the **sphygmomanometer** where you can easily read it without holding it.
   - Insert the **stethoscope ear tips** into your ears, facing forward.

4. **Locate the Brachial Pulse**:
   - Palpate the **brachial artery** at the elbow crease and place the **stethoscope diaphragm** over the pulse point. Hold it lightly against the skin.

5. **Inflate the Cuff**:
   - Tighten the valve and inflate the cuff using the **bulb**.
   - Inflate to **160 mmHg**. If you hear a pulse, increase to **200 mmHg**. If the pulse is still audible, continue in **20 mmHg increments** until you can no longer hear it.






### **Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure:**
- **Systolic Blood Pressure**: This is the **top number** in a blood pressure reading. It measures the **pressure in the arteries** when the heart **contracts** and pumps blood out to the body. It indicates how much pressure the blood exerts against the artery walls when the heart is actively beating.
  
- **Diastolic Blood Pressure**: This is the **bottom number** in a blood pressure reading. It measures the **pressure in the arteries** when the heart is at rest between beats. This shows how much pressure the blood exerts on the artery walls when the heart is filling with blood.

### **Normal Blood Pressure Readings**:
- **Normal Blood Pressure**: A typical reading is around **120/80 mmHg**.
  - **Systolic**: 90–120 mmHg
  - **Diastolic**: 60–80 mmHg
- **Elevated Blood Pressure**: 120–129 systolic and less than 80 diastolic.
- **Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)**:
  - **Stage 1**: 130–139 systolic or 80–89 diastolic.
  - **Stage 2**: 140 or higher systolic or 90 or higher diastolic.
- **Hypotension (Low Blood Pressure)**: Generally, readings **below 90/60 mmHg** are considered low and may indicate hypotension.
